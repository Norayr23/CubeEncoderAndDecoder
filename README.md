Cube Encoder and Decoder

Cube Encoder and Decoder is a versatile tool that allows you to encode and decode messages or files using a cube encoding algorithm. It provides two modes of operation: file-based and command-line interface (CLI).
Features
File-Based Mode
In file-based mode, the program can perform the following operations:
Encoding
    If you provide a source file, the program encodes the file using the cube encoding algorithm.
    The encoded data is saved to a new file, and a key file is generated to facilitate decoding.
Decoding
    If you provide an encoded file and a key file, the program decodes the data and saves it to a new file.
    Ensure that you provide both the encoded file as a first file and the corresponding key file as a second for successful decoding.
Command-Line Interface (CLI)

In CLI mode, you can interact with the program directly from the command line. The following commands are supported:
Encoding
    Encode a message or text directly from the command line.
    The encoded message is displayed on the screen.
Decoding
    Decode an encoded message from the command line.
    You'll need to provide the encoded message and the key for successful decoding.
